 Description: This program creates a 2D dynamic array
 for students and their test scores. The number of students
 and number of tests are recieved by the user. the program 
 allocates the proper amount of memeory and then displays the 
 averages for each student.

/*
 Function:      getGrades
 Parameters:    a pointer to a 2D array for students and test scores
                a pointer to a 1Dmatrix that stores student averages  
                an int for the number of students 
 Return:        void
 Description:   processes test scores for students and finds their averages

 Function:      dispAverages
 Parameters:    a pointer to an average array
 Return:        void
 Description:   displays the averages in the array
